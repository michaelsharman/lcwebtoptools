Introduction
-------------------------------

This FarCry plugin contains tools to assist you in debugging a typical FarCry project. Currently there is a:
 - Database Diff
 - Content Object Meta

The database diff looks for case-sensitivity differences between your ColdFusion components and the actual MySQL table names (MySQL only)

The Content Object Meta assists in finding information about content of any "type" in FarCry, based of the title, objectId or friendly URL


Requirements
-------------------------------

This was built on

    Railo 3.2+
    ColdFusion 7+
    FarCry 6+
    MySQL 5+


Installation
-------------------------------

"Official" notes on installing FarCry plugins can be found here: https://farcry.jira.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12943398

It's pretty simple though:
 - add the "lcwebtoptools" directory from git into /farcry/plugins/
 - add "lcwebtoptools" to THIS.plugins in farcryConstructor.cfm (in your project webroot)
	e.g. <cfset THIS.plugins = "farcrycms,lcwebtoptools">

Restart your app, that's it. No coapi changes need to be made. To access the current tools, go to the "Admin" tab and choose "Webtop Tools" from the drop down.
